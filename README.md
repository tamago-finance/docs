# TAMAGO FINANCE ü•ö

Welcome to the Tamago finance documentation. Tamago Finance is an NFT issuance protocol that creates the financial elements for NFTs and Metaverse.

At present, the price volatility of NFTs and the Metaverse-related assets remain relatively high. The general perception of NFTs being high-risk assets has caused many potential users to steer clear of the NFT universe.

To bring out the full potential of financial NFTs, we believe in creating price stability for financial NFTs. Tamago Finance enables this vision by allowing users to issue value-backed NFTs, created via depositing ERC20 tokens to keep the NFT price pegged to its collateral.

With greater NFT price stability, the possibilities are endless. Tamago Finance can provide a space for the issuance of more complex financial instruments, including interest-bearing instruments, leveraged products, and more. Eventually one may be able to combine with long-tail NFTs to provide liquidity like Uniswap (but in NFT format).

With the development of Decentralized Finance, explorations of bringing NFTs into more tangible scenarios of finance are conceiving the concept of ‚ÄúFinancial NFTs‚Äù - NFTs that are representing and certifying any type of financial equity.

Tamago Finance is a protocol that allows users to generate a financial asset in the form of ERC-1155 NFT on any EVM-compatible chain. The protocol can generate currencies, commodities, and digital assets to strengthen infrastructure facilities on NFT-centric environments and cross-chain NFT asset bridges.

Besides, Tamago Finance also has a place NFT Luckbox platform that allows users to run a campaign on it

Tamago Finance is currently on Polygon, Ethereum Mainnet with the following products/components:

* **Value-backed NFT** - An algorithmic synthetic asset that represents the specific amount of underlying asset, to mint NFT, offset fees and discounts will be given dynamically from the bonding curve to help stabilize the value of collateral reserves against outstanding NFTs.
* **NFT Luckbox** - NFT Luckbox is a community-driven giveaway tool for Web3 & NFT projects. Built on open and collaborative infrastructure. NFT Luckbox helps Web3 projects and NFT artists connect with other NFT holders and build better communities. At the same time, the NFT holders who contribute to the listing network have a chance to participate in the growth of the new projects.
